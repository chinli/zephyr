HTTP Client Support in Zephyr
-----------------------------

The HTTP client is based BSD socket API, it implement the request method of
GET and POST, and processed with synchronization only.
Besides, the api of http client is simple and easy use.

1. Usage
 <1> At first, call http_client_init function to get host ip and create socket
 connection, the http_ctx will save the socket id.

 <2> The sencond, call http_client_get or http_client_post to request. User
 can set the input parameter keep_alive when need keep the connection alive.
 Otherwise, user can call the http_add_header_field function to set callback
 when it need processing special feature, such as add  Range/Content-Type
 to request header, or process the response body would call the
 http_set_resp_callback function.

 if user need repeat to request, then just call http_client_get or
 http_client_post again.

 <3> Finally, close the http connection when call http_client_close.


 2. trouble shoot
  <1> call http_client_init return error.
  error code [-101]: it means system intenal error, maybe DHCP can not
  successful, user need check local networking was normal or not.

  <2> call http_client_get or http_client_post return error.
  error code [-1]: it means connection is cutoff, user need excute
  http_client_close to close http connect and reconnect by http_client_init.
